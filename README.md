# Quine-McCluskey
The Quine-McCluskey algorithm is a method used to simplify boolean expressions. This is an implementation of the algorithm using Python.

##  Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/rafaelfigueredog/Quine-McCluskey.git`
2. Change to the project directory: `cd Quine-McCluskey`

## Usage 

~~~bash
python main.py
~~~

## How it Works
The Quine-McCluskey algorithm works by comparing the minterms of a boolean expression to each other and grouping those that differ by only one bit. It continues to group the resulting terms until no more grouping is possible. The resulting groups are used to generate the simplified boolean expression.
